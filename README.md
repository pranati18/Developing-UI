# Developing-UI
This repository contains my project called the Chef Oracle. This project has been developed for educational purposes
and it focuses on developing User Interfaces.
The goal of the project is to help chefs of all backgrounds to help decide what they want to cook with the aid of choosing 
from multiple food and health choices.

To run this project successfully:
1. Run the project within a dynamic web project on a local server(I used Apache Tomcat version 8 on Eclipse Mars IDE's Dynamic Web Project)
2. All the static contents such as the bootstrap, jquery and images are stored in the web contents folder.
All copyrights are reserved to the pictures used in the project.
3. Run the project by starting the server and using the link of local host and its port number or directly run the project through the IDE used.
4. To run this project on the browser use link - http://localhost:8080/ChefOracle/page1.html
